             <p>My analysis of the competition ecompassed a review of their branding, content, and functionality, but at
                 this point I was interested in reviewing user flows to help define the minimum viable product and
                 proactively preventing convoluted flows from emerging in the upcoming design.</p>

             <p>I still had a relatively loose idea of the scope the product, but was able to define some initial
                 necessary functions:
                 <em><br><br>
                     - Quick access to a positive affirmation statement
                     <br><br>
                     - The ability to share affirmations
                     <br><br>
                     - The ability to filter/sort affirmations by category
                     <br><br>
                     - Access to additional resources</em></p>
             <h4>User surveys</h4>
             <p>The potential users I surveyed yielded results that helped expound on these functions, and provided
                 insight into how the presentation of said functions could effect the experience.</p>

             <h4>User Stories</h4>
             <p>Armed with survey data and freshly developed personas I began painting a picture of the motivations
                 behind the needs and desires of future users, and in turn provided ideas for features that would
                 address those needs. <em>Here are a few:</em></p>
             <div class="hiddenContainerGrid">
                 <span class="dandelion stories">
                     <h5> I <em>need</em> to be able to...</h5>
                     <p>Access mental health resources</p>
                     <p>So that I have the ability to seek help from professionals equipped to properly assess my
                         particular issue.</p>
                     <p><em>Solution:</em> Ensure that the library of resources is front-facing, easy to access, and
                         easy to navigate.</p>
                     <br>
                 </span>

                 <span class="dandelion stories">
                     <h5> I <em>need</em> to be able to...</h5>
                     <p>Quickly be shown a positive affirmation</p>
                     <p>So that I can feel calmer, happier, or better about myself.</p>
                     <p><em>Solution:</em> Allow users to bypass onboarding, or make the sign in/sign up process as
                         brief as possible.</p>
                     <br>
                 </span>

                 <span class="dandelion stories">
                     <h5> I <em>want</em> to be able to...</h5>
                     <p>Create and save my own custom affirmations</p>
                     <p>So that I record and recall a positive statement that is particularly effective for me.</p>
                     <p><em>Solution:</em> Allow users to personalize their own affirmation messages by providing an
                         easy to access "add affirmation" feature.</p>

                 </span>
             </div>
             <h4>Sitemapping/content creation</h4>
             <p>The content of Affirmative is constantly evolving as a result of the growing library of resources and
                 the neccessity to refresh and update affirmation statements, but before I could begin wireframing and
                 laying out content I had to have an extensive idea of what exactly that content would be. So I set
                 about compiling as many resources for mental wellness and spreadsheets full of affirmations as
                 possible, then established the static copy, images, and graphics.</p>
             <img src="images/dandelion/sitemap.png" />
             <h4>User flows</h4>
             <p>Previous research indicated that a consistent complaint in similar apps is the inflated onboarding,
                 onslaught of CTAs, and overcomplication of the road to the primary functionality. I knew that I had to
                 prioritize quick and easy access to the contents of the app and set about designing flows that fit the
                 bill.</p>
             <button class="accordion clickItflow"><i id="caretflow" class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>
                 <h5 id="" class="clickItflow"> Initial user flow</h5>

                 <img src="images/dandelion/initialflow.png" />

             </div>
             <p>A simple solution than the lengthy flow above would be to supply a prominently displayed option for the
                 user to <em>choose</em> to bypass onboarding if they want to get to the primary functions quickly.</p>
             <img src="images/dandelion/simplifiedflow.png">

         <div class="dandelion ideate">
             <h3>Ideation</h3>
             <h4>Sketching + Wireframing</h4>


             <p>The initial idea was to bypass onboarding entirely and allow users to be thrust immediately into the
                 main function: picking a random affirmation card. However, iterating and testing wireframe sketches
                 proved this to be wildly shortsighted, and gave users no context or introduction to the functions or
                 brand.</p>


             <p>With the pared down onboarding flow in mind, I started the wireframing process by prioritizing flows
                 from app launch to 2 destinations: random affirmation, and the mental health resources library.</p>

             <h4>Paper protoype + testing</h4>
             <p>I worked out several different options for a pared down onboarding process and an engaging presentation
                 of the affirmations. I put those options in front of testers in the forms of low fidelity and paper
                 prototypes.</p>

                 impeded comprehension of the more important content: the card title and the affirmation.</p>
             <br>

             <p>More clarity was required to shed light on what functions were possible within the card view. This would
                 prove important as analysis of future usability tests would neccessitate the home screen layout being
                 reorganized to take on some of the burden of the action bar.</p>
             <br>

             <p>Revisions based on reactions from the introductory round of prototyping led me to this layout, which
                 proper fixates the line of site on the content of the card, then grounds the experience at the bottom
                 center where the user can assess acting on a row of action buttons prior to deciding to draw another
                 card.</p>

             <p>The home screen and the card view overlay (and subsequent actions) are the most liable to highlight weak
                 spots in the logic and information architecture of the app, and as a new iteration overtook its
                 predecessor, I was finding that it was imparative to triple check that it wasn't interrupting a current
                 flow or path.</p>
             <h4>Brand Development</h4>
             <p>Branding an application that inherently fits into the self-help genre is difficult to do without
                 careening down the slippery slope of new age cliches, but it was vital to avoid these pitfalls. First
                 of all, most users find branding of affirmations related products off-putting. Secondly, a primary
                 motivation of this app is to ensure people reach out for help when they really need it, and the
                 archetypical branding of self-help products relies upon the notion that the product itself is enough to
                 "heal" the user.</p>

             <p>In the next section I'll go into further detail about user testing, but it's worth noting here that due
                 to feedback given during one of the sessions discussed below, I was compelled to reassess my branding
                 choices. One user in particular felt very strongly that the messaging of the app was starkly contrasted
                 to the general aesthetic, so I took a brief look back at my early notes, and realized that they were
                 right! I hadn't been framing all of my branding choices around the original intentions of the app.
                 Without this honest feedback in an early on preference test, it may have been much further down the
                 line that I realized this error.</p>

             <h4>Preference testing</h4>
             <p>I ran a few preference tests through Maze before continuing with high fidelity prototypes. For these
                 tests I matched up 2-3 elements with differences in style and let participants simply choose which they
                 prefer. If the correllation was strong, say 65% or more, in favor of a certain style, I would expand on
                 that idea and continue testing until I was able to narrow down a consistent aesthetic across UI
                 components.</p>

             <h4>First Usability Test</h4>

             <p><em>Successes:</em>
                 <br>Two of the most highly prioritized features recieved 100% success rates, with no users failing to
                 execute the function</p>
             <p>When asked to <em>pick a card</em> 100% of users found the expected flow in an average of 9 seconds.
             </p>
             <p>When asked to <em>find mental health resources</em> 90% of users found the expected flow and 10% took an
                 alternate path in an average of 7 seconds. </p>

             <p><em>Failures:</em>
                 <br>Onboarding was taking too long, and a complex flow was difficult to navigate</p>
             <p>When asked to <em>create an account</em> only 25% of users found the expected flow, 66.7% found an
                 alternate path, and 8.3% gave up. An average of 19.6 seconds was spent on the task </p>
             <p>When asked to <em>create a new affirmation</em> 22.2% of users found the expected flow, 55.6% took an
                 alternate path, while a staggering %22.2 percent gave up. This flow is lenghty in and of itself, but
                 the user average was still too high at around 30 seconds. </p>

             <p>Inspecting the heat maps from these sessions gave me further insight as to where exactly users were
                 getting confused, hung up, or frustrated.</p>
