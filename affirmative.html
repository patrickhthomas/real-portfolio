  <div class="affirmative intro">
    <h3>Affirmative.</h3>
    <p>Affirmative is a positive thinking app for IOS that emulates a deck of affirmations. In other words, it’s a collection of positive statements presented in a playing card format that the user can then read, collect, and share. More importantly, Affirmative houses a growing library of resources committed to assisting those strugglings with a wide variety of mental health issues. </p>
    <br>
    <p><em>My role:</em>  User research, user flows, information architecture, sketching, wireframing, brand development, UI design, prototyping, usability testing.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="affirmative goals">
    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
    <p>
    A handful of applications exist that present affirmations, but there are few that give their users the option to reach out for further assistance when their self-help app doesn’t solve all of their problems. The primary challenge would be to design a system that strikes a balance between promoting the benefits of positive thinking and acknowledging the pitfalls of relying upon it for serious issues.</p>

    <h3>The Goal</h3>
    <p><em>1.</em> Design an iOS app in the mental wellness genre that breaks the mold of self-help cliches.</p>
    <p> <em>2.</em> Create a game-like experience that attracts a wide user pool, but doesn’t alienate more serious users. </p>
    <p><em>3.</em> Maintain a continuously growing library that provides specified mental wellness resources, accounting for people from a wide swath of races, gender identities, sexual orientations, religious affiliations, and age groups. </p>

  </div>



  <div class="affirmative evolution">
    <h4>Evolution of the design</h4>
    <p><em>Discover:</em><br>Competitive research, user surveys, interviews, personas</p>
    <p><em>Definition:</em>
    <br>User stories, minimum viable functionality, information architecture, content creation, user flows</p>
    <p><em>Ideation:</em>
    <br>Sketches, wireframing, initial testing, intro to brand development</p>
    <p><em>Prototyping + Testing:</em>
    <br>Test functionality, comprehension and communication of content, usability</p>
    <p><em>Solidification</em>
    <br>Another primer of preference and usability testing, then revise, rinse, repeat</p>
  </div>


  <div class="affirmative discover">
    <h3>Discovery</h3>
    <h4>
    Researching the competition</h4>
    <p>My analysis of the competition ecompassed a review of their branding, content, and functionality, but at this point I was interested in reviewing user flows to help define the minimum viable product and proactively preventing convoluted flows from emerging in the upcoming design.</p>




       <button class="accordion clickIt"><i id="caret" class="fas fa-caret-right"></i><h5 id="" class="clickIt">  Competition's user flows</h5></button>
  <div class="hidden" id="hidden">        

          <img src="images/affirmative/compflow1.jpg"/>
     


          <img src="images/affirmative/compflow2.jpg"/>


          <img class="myImg1" src="images/affirmative/compflow3.jpg"/>

</div>





    <p>I still had a relatively loose idea of the scope the product, but was able to define some initial necessary functions:
      <em><br><br>
      - Quick access to a positive affirmation statement
      <br><br>
      - The ability to share affirmations
      <br><br>
      - The ability to filter/sort affirmations by category
      <br><br>
    - Access to additional resources</em></p>
    <h4>User surveys</h4>
    <p>The potential users I surveyed yielded results that helped expound on these functions, and provided insight into how the presentation of said functions could effect the experience.</p>
    <br>
    <p><em>Notable results and quotes:</em></p>
    <p class="quote"><em>80%</em> are familiar with the concept of affirmation</p>


    <p class="quote"><em>60%</em> practice affirmation themselves</p>

    <p class="quote"><em>50%</em> find it helpful</p>

    <p class="quote">those who are unfamiliar do <em>not</em> think it’s something that they might enjoy/appreciate</p>

    <p class="quote"><em>No one</em> reported handling their stress in a very healthy way</p>

    <p class="quote">over <em>90%</em> reported low confidence in themselves</p>

    <p class="quote">The <em>majority</em> can easily laugh at themselves</p>

    <p class="quote"><em>No one</em> has a positive opinion of self help materials</p>

    <p class="quote"><em>93%</em> think there might be an unnecessary stigma surrounding mental wellness</p>

    <p class="quote"><em>60%</em> reported an decrease in their own mental wellbeing since the COVID crisis</p>

    <p class="quote"><em>75%</em> were between the ages of 18-50, <em>40%</em> 26-35</p>

    <p class="quote"><em>“I could definitely cut myself some slack.”</em></p>

    <p class="quote"><em>“I’m always open to new things, and I don’t doubt that positive thinking can make you feel better.”</em></p>

    <p class="quote"><em>“I try to make positive affirmations a daily part of my routine...At first I thought they were kind of lame, but I really think it helps me out.”</em></p>
  </div>

  <div class="affirmative definition">
    <h3>Definition</h3>
    <h4>Personas</h4>
    <p>It was important to remain approachable and accessible to users from all walks of life, so I surveyed and interviewed a wide range of demographics, and I developed personas based on the diverse responses I collected</p>
     <button class="accordion clickIt2"><i id="caret2" class="fas fa-caret-right"></i> <h5 id="" class="clickIt2"> User personas</h5></button>

  <div class="hidden" id="hidden2">        


          <img src="images/affirmative/Affirmation-Personas-01.jpg" />


  
          <img src="images/affirmative/Affirmation-Personas-02.jpg" />
  </div>
  


    <!--IMG-->
    <!--paragraph-->
    <h4>User Stories</h4>
    <p>Armed with survey data and freshly developed personas I began painting a picture of the motivations behind the needs and desires of future users, and in turn provided ideas for features that would address those needs. <em>Here are a few:</em></p>
    <div class="hiddenContainerGrid">
    <span class="affirmative stories">
      <h5> I <em>need</em> to be able to...</h5>
      <p>Access mental health resources</p>
      <p>So that I have the ability to seek help from professionals equipped to properly assess my particular issue.</p>
      <p><em>Solution:</em> Ensure that the library of resources is front-facing, easy to access, and easy to navigate.</p>
      <br>
    </span>

    <span class="affirmative stories">
      <h5> I <em>need</em> to be able to...</h5>
      <p>Quickly be shown a positive affirmation</p>
      <p>So that I can feel calmer, happier, or better about myself.</p>
      <p><em>Solution:</em> Allow users to bypass onboarding, or make the sign in/sign up process as brief as possible.</p>
      <br>
    </span>

    <span class="affirmative stories">
      <h5> I <em>want</em> to be able to...</h5>
      <p>Create and save my own custom affirmations</p>
      <p>So that I record and recall a positive statement that is particularly effective for me.</p>
      <p><em>Solution:</em> Allow users to personalize their own affirmation messages by providing an easy to access "add affirmation" feature.</p>
      <br>
    </span>
  </div>
    <h4>Sitemapping/content creation</h4>
    <p>The content of Affirmative is constantly evolving as a result of the growing library of resources and the neccessity to refresh and update affirmation statements, but before I could begin wireframing and laying out content I had to have an extensive idea of what exactly that content would be. So I set about compiling as many resources for mental wellness and spreadsheets full of affirmations as possible, then established the static copy, images, and graphics.</p>
    <img src="images/affirmative/sitemap.png" />
    <h4>User flows</h4>
     <p>Previous research indicated that a consistent complaint in similar apps is the inflated onboarding, onslaught of CTAs, and overcomplication of the road to the primary functionality. I knew that I had to prioritize quick and easy access to the contents of the app and set about designing flows that fit the bill.</p>
  <button class="accordion clickItflow"><i id="caretflow" class="fas fa-caret-right"></i><h5 id="" class="clickItflow">  Initial user flow</h5></button>
  <div class="hidden" id="hiddenflow">        

     <img src="images/affirmative/initialflow.png" />

</div>
<p>A simple solution than the lengthy flow above would be to supply a prominently displayed option for the user to <em>choose</em> to bypass onboarding if they want to get to the primary functions quickly.</p>
 <img src="images/affirmative/simplifiedflow.png">

  </div>

  <div class="affirmative ideate">
    <h3>Ideation</h3>
    <h4>Sketching + Wireframing</h4>

    
    <p>The initial idea was to bypass onboarding entirely and allow users to be thrust immediately into the main function: picking a random affirmation card. However, iterating and testing wireframe sketches proved this to be wildly shortsighted, and gave users no context or introduction to the functions or brand.</p>

   
    <p>With the pared down onboarding flow in mind, I started the wireframing process by prioritizing flows from app launch to 2 destinations: random affirmation, and the mental health resources library.</p>
    <!--IMG-->

  <button class="accordion clickIt3"><i id="caret3" class="fas fa-caret-right"></i> <h5 id="" class="clickIt3"> Wireframe sketches</h5></button>
  <div class="hidden" id="hidden3">        

        <div class="hiddenContainerGrid">
          <img src="images/affirmative/sketch1.jpg" />
 

          <img src="images/affirmative/sketch2.jpg" />

          <img src="images/affirmative/sketch5.jpg" />

          <img src="images/affirmative/sketch5.jpg" />
        </div>

</div>
<h4>Paper protoype + testing</h4>
 <p>I worked out several different options for a pared down onboarding process and an engaging presentation of the affirmations. I put those options in front of testers in the forms of low fidelity and paper prototypes.</p>


  <button class="accordion clickIt4"><i id="caret4" class="fas fa-caret-right"></i> <h5 id="" class="clickIt4"> Paper prototype</h5></button>
  <div class="hidden" id="hidden4">        

        <div class="hiddenContainerGrid">
          <img src="images/affirmative/paper1.jpg" />

          <img src="images/affirmative/paper2.jpg" />

          <img src="images/affirmative/paper3.jpg" />
          <img src="images/affirmative/paper4.jpg" />
          <img src="images/affirmative/paper5.jpg" />
          <img src="images/affirmative/paper6.jpg" />
          <img src="images/affirmative/paper7.jpg" />
          <img src="images/affirmative/paper8.jpg" />
          <img src="images/affirmative/paper9.jpg" />
          <img src="images/affirmative/paper10.jpg" />
          <img src="images/affirmative/paper11.jpg" />
          <img src="images/affirmative/paper12.jpg" />
          <img src="images/affirmative/paper13.jpg" />
          <img src="images/affirmative/paper14.jpg" />

</div>


</div>

  <p>Neccessary revisions became apparent while testing first and second iterations of wireframes and paper prototypes. </p>

  <button class="accordion clickIt5"><i id="caret5" class="fas fa-caret-right"></i><h5 id="" class="clickIt5">  Wireframe revisions</h5></button>
  <div class="hidden" id="hidden5">    

        <div class="hiddenContainerGrid">    

          <span>
            <p>Card view, 1st iteration</p>
          <img src="images/affirmative/wirecard1.jpg" />
            <p>Presenting the user with the name of the category that the card is in (deck name) was superfluous and impeded comprehension of the more important content: the card title and the affirmation.</p>
         </span>

         <span>
          <p>Card view, 2nd iteration</p>
          <img src="images/affirmative/wirecard2.jpg" />
          <p>More clarity was required to shed light on what functions were possible within the card view. This would prove important as analysis of future usability tests would neccessitate the home screen layout being reorganized to take on some of the burden of the action bar.</p>
        </span>

        <span>
          <p>Card view, 3rd iteration</p>
          <img src="images/affirmative/wirecard3.jpg" />
          <p>Revisions based on reactions from the introductory round of prototyping led me to this layout, which proper fixates the line of site on the content of the card, then grounds the experience at the bottom center where the user can assess acting on a row of action buttons prior to deciding to draw another card.</p>
        </span>

        <span>
          <p>Home screen and action bar</p>
          <img src="images/affirmative/wirehome1.jpg" />
        </span>

        <span>
          <p>Home screen with added context</p>
          <img src="images/affirmative/wirehome2.jpg" />
        </span>

        <span>
          <p>Home screen with added functions</p>
          <img src="images/affirmative/wirehome3.jpg" />
        </span>

        <span>
          <p>Home screen with more functions</p>
          <img src="images/affirmative/wirehome4.jpg" />
        </span>

   </div>






</div>
 <p>The home screen and the card view overlay (and subsequent actions) are the most liable to highlight weak spots in the logic and information architecture of the app, and as a new iteration overtook its predecessor, I was finding that it was imparative to triple check that it wasn't interrupting a current flow or path.</p>
<h4>Brand Development</h4>
<p>Branding an application that inherently fits into the self-help genre is difficult to do without careening down the slippery slope of new age cliches, but it was vital to avoid these pitfalls. First of all, most users find branding of affirmations related products off-putting. Secondly, a primary motivation of this app is to ensure people reach out for help when they really need it, and the archetypical branding of self-help products relies upon the notion that the product itself is enough to "heal" the user.</p>
