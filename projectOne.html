            <p>When it comes to the creative process, an uninterrupted workflow can mean the difference between a stroke of inspiration and starting at a blank page. Coop wants to provide an online platform that allows teams to remotely create, share, and collaborate on projects without having to lose momentum. In addition to conducting research and developing the designs necessary to implement this task, I was happy to be able to craft an identity that accurately reflects the vision of the stakeholders and users alike.</p><br>

            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>Services that are intended to facilitate remote work often cater to a homogenized user pool and often leave a large portion of users with a cluttered interface and extraneous features. Additionally, certain demographics that require a prioritization of collaboration, social connection, and iteration control are overlooked.</p>

            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>We developed an application that caters to the creative industry workforce, which we discovered is a widely overlooked demographic in this market. What emerged after iterating and testing our designs is an application that prioritizes features that assist creative workflow and social interaction without hindering a wider user pool from engaging in the baseline file storage and sharing capabilities. </p>

          <h1>the discovery phase</h1>
          <p>At the outset it was understood that the intention was to introduce a new application to the remote file storage and sharing market. Otherwise, it was too early to begin shaping the end product. We still needed to research the market and survey potential users to discover the identity and desires of our target audience.</p>
          <br>
          
          
          <p>I deployed an initial survey to determine the most frequently used remote storage and file sharing apps, then started with a comprehensive SWOT analysis of each of them. I then diagrammed user flows for each application, detailing three key actions: onboarding, saving an item, and organizing items. This helped to distinguish consistent or unique elements that exist in the competition’s user flows, and made helped me form an understanding of the nuances that set each apart.</p>
          
          
          <p>I was starting to form a better understanding of the competition, but I still needed to deploy another more extensive round of user surveys in order to nail down a clearer picture of our power user, and what features will dominate our minimum viable product.</p>

              <p>It was made clear that users who rely heavily and specifically on file organization and text editing features are generally happy with the products they’re currently using. In tandem with my prior market research, it appeared as if our competitors have a stronghold on office and professional use. Dissatisfied users generally wished that collaboration features were more prevalent. These users reported having jobs in marketing, illustration, and design, meaning our competitors don’t have a firm grip on a creative audience. After reviewing this user study, I was able to determine the best path forward was to position the product as a storage hub that makes collaboration on remote creative projects more convenient and accessible. The key features revolving around real-time collaboration, and social connectivity.</p>

          <p>Before going any further, it was important to put these early iterations in front of some test subjects. The primary focus for these initial tests was to ensure that the structure, logic of the flow patterns, and information architecture were translating well to the user, and if they weren’t, use the opportunity to properly identify the problem and develop solutions based on user feedback. </p><br> <br><p>The first round of usability testing was showing that the previous effort poured establishling the foundation for the design proved effective, but more importantly I was able to identify a few immensely important components of the design that needed to corrected. A few of the testers experienced enough confusion with the onboarding process to warrant an audit of the current flow pattern. With their feedback I was able to identify the pain points and provide a more descriptive but less overbearing onboarding approach.</p>

          <p>The colors I picked were chosen based on the previous moodboards, and were picked with the intention to be used sparingly across the platform. A complementary pallete gives the ability to draw attention to important functional aspects while maintaining conservative use of heavy fill colors.</p>

          <h3>Leveraging the style guide</h3>
          
          <p>The style guide was put to work immediately as an atlas for layering the branding aspects over the wireframes.</p><br>
          
  
          
          <p>Key elements as well as whole page layouts were then paired with their alternatively styled counterparts and put in front of an audience for a series of preference tests. When the results established a pattern, I made revisions to reflect the feedback.</p><br>

          <h3>High Fidelity Prototype</h3>
          
          <p>Feeling almost ready to apply the finishing touches on this project, I transformed the new mock-ups into another clickable prototype through InVision. I then turned to another pool of testers to give more feedback. With the vast majority of the structural and functional kinks worked out, I was given feeback that primarily focused on the aesthetic portion of the design. I also wanted to ensure that any implementation of the branding wasn’t impeding on the previously refined functional qualities. </p><br>
          <h3>Final Refinements</h3>
          
          <p>Adjusting to the feedback from this round of prototype testing was the last step in finalizing the Coop prototype and wrapping up this project.</p><br><br>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          
          <p>There are well established products that offer remote collaboration and content storage, but through this project I was able to create a brand and functional platform that caters to a user pool that this market typically doesn’t account for.With giants like Google Drive occupying the scene, it’s difficult to imagine establishing a design system that outweighs the competition. However, I was surprised to find my own user flows that proved easier to use in usability tests.That said, the competition dominating this market is generally feature-rich to an extent I wasn’t able to reach. While the minimum viable product was certainly delivered, given more time, I would have supplied Coop users with the ability to create spreadsheets, collaborate over video, or complete other more complex tasks.</p><br>
