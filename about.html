        <h3 id="who-Head">Who are you?</h3>
        <p class="pl">
          Like any good grade school student I put down more ink doodling in the margins than by taking actual notes, but I was lucky enough to have my distracted scribblings evolve into a more concrete appreciation for artsy stuff. By high school I was carrying my camera everywhere, along with loose dreams of one day becoming a Nat Geo photographer.
        </p>
        <p class="pr">
         After high school I spent time studying foundational subjects like figure drawing and color theory. As I spent more time away from the viewfinder, I started to see how the same satisfaction I received from processing a photograph could be achieved by constructing compositions in all forms of media.
        </p>
      </div>
      



      <div class="border about b">
        <h3 id="then-Head">Cool, but why UX?</h3>
        <p class="pl">
          While this was most likely a healthy revelation for my artistic identity, my financial identity didn't necessarily have the time to wait around for the end result. Ultimately I found myself managing a bottle shop and curating their beer collection. I then started brewing with a small brewpub and shortly thereafter began a 7 year stint of commercial brewing and startup brewery consulting.
          Throughout that time I was often creating marketing content or illustrating beer labels. 
        </p>
        <p class="pr">
           I spent additional time freelancing packaging rebrands, product photography, and logo design. Eventually I realized that my background in the arts was catching up to me. After speaking with a developer friend about UX design I started teaching myself some front end code in my free time. After months of unguided learning, I began the process of properly solidifying my new skillset through an immersive UX apprenticeship with bloc.io.
        </p>          
      </div>

      <div class="border about c">
        <h3 id="why-Head">Yeah, then what?</h3>
        <p class="pl">
          I fully understand that some might see the transition from beer production to UX design as a strange trajectory. Getting paid to drink beer is an ideal scenario, right? In short, sort of. For one, I'm not super keen on drinking on the job, and a brewer's job is generally far too demanding for the intermittent pint anyway.
        </p> 
        <p class="pr">
          Regardless, my departure from brewing was less about a distaste for making beer, and more related to an unmet desire to create things that really make a difference in a person's daily life. Striving for good UX means employing a high degree of empathy, which means no matter how small the problem may seem, the solution mean a lot for a certain user.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="border about d">
        <h3 id="why-Head">Wrap it up!</h3>
        <p class="pl">
          My prior experience has taught me that the operations behind the curtain must be precise and purpose driven in order for a product to meet the consumer's expectations, and the lessons I learned upon delving into UX immediately echoed those sentiments. I've come to realize the importance of balancing relentless creative output and reliance upon a set of rigid, proven principles. 
        </p>
        <p class="pr">
          Striking this balance allows me as a designer to pour my energy in a project but do so with efficiency, and that's something I thoroughly enjoy doing.
